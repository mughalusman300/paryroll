						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">The purpose of this document is to establish guidelines to employees in relation to taking sick leaves, and to manage sick leaves in a consistent manner.</p>

						      			</div>

						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #000;">Scope :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">This policy applies to all full time employees of Fragomen UAE who are unable to work because of illness or injury, and/or have a scheduled medical or dental appointment.</p>

						      			</div>

						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #000;">Reporting of Sickness Absence :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">You are required to inform your Line Manager and/or Human Resources before 9:00 AM on the first day of unplanned sickness absence.  Failing to report your absence as stated above may result in taking the sick leave against your leave balance or without pay. If information is provided through the Line Manager, the latter will be required to notify Human Resources before 10:00 AM to enable HR incorporate the absence in the daily leave announcement.</p>

						      			</div>
						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;color: #000"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;">One day Sickness:   Completion of Self-Certification Form/Medical Certificate (refer to attachment)</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">If you have been absent for one day due to sickness you may complete a Sickness Self-Certification Form.  It is your responsibility to ensure that a Self-Certification Form is completed and handed over to HR on the first day you return to work. Self-certification is only allowed for a maximum of  4 times in a calendar year.  If there are more than 4 absences of one day, a medical certificate will be required for each additional day's leave.</p>

						      			</div>
						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;color: #000"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;">Two days sickness but not more than five days :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">A medical certificate is needed for each sickness more than a day.</p>

						      			</div>
						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;color: #000"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;">Continued Sickness Absence of more than 5 days :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">In this event, the Firm reserves the right to request a medical certificate if it considers it appropriate, for example if there are concerns about your medical suitability for any particular duty or aspect of your job. The Firm may also request a report from your medical advisor on your health. Alternatively, the Firm may request that you undergo an examination for the purposes of a medical report being prepared by a nominated medical practitioner.  Refusal to agree to any such reasonable request by the Firm will be treated as a breach of good faith with the Firm.  The Firm will pay for any report it requests.</p>

						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">If you are sick on the day you were supposed to resume work either after a public holiday or an annual leave, you must submit a medical certificate for your absence or the leave will be taken against your annual leave balance.</p>

						      			</div>
						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;color: #000"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;">Employee Refusing to Complete a Form or provide medical certificate :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">Occasionally, employees may be reluctant to complete a form which discloses details of a medical problem.  If you refuse to do so, you will be referred to the Practice Leader and/or Partner.  If you ultimately refuse to complete the form or provide the certificate as required, the Firm may not pay you for your absence.</p>

						      			<div style="margin-top: 5px; float: left; margin-left: 40px;color: #000"><div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;">Payment for Sickness Absence :</div> 
						      			<p style="margin-top: 5px;">Entitlement to, and payment to you of Statutory Sick Pay is to be in line UAE Labor Law as follows:
						      			</br>
						      			An employee who has completed more than six months of continuous service, after the completion of his/her probationary period, is entitled to take up to 90 days of sick leave, consecutive or non- consecutive, for each year of service. Such employees are entitled to receive sick pay as follows:
						      			</br>
						      			<ul style="margin-left: 20px; ">
						      				<li>The first 15 calendar days with full pay</li>
						      				<li>The next 30 calendar days with half pay</li>
						      				<li>Any subsequent period(s) without pay</li>
						      			</ul>
						      			</br>
						      			However, as noted above, failure to provide a self-certification form or medical certificate (as required)
						      			will result in sickness leave being unpaid or taken against annual leave credit.
						      			</br>
						      			The  Labour  Law  provides that  employees  are  not  entitled to  receive sick  pay  until  they have completed their probationary period.
						      			</br>
						      			No sick leave is payable if the employee's illness is a direct result of the use of illicit drugs.
